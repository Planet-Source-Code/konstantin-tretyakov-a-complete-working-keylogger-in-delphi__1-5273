## A COMPLETE WORKING KEYLOGGER IN DELPHI


</div>

### Description

OK, I've received some feedbacks on my VB 'Hooking' keylogger asking for DLL code.

I am sorry that I didn't post it then 'cause I thought it to be too basic for a person who knows Delphi/C and too advances for the person who is interested in VB only.

Well: here's the Keylogger. BTW it will show to some of you how to use the GetKeyName function. I mean, there is no such code: IF Keycode=13 then Log("Enter"), if KeyCode=27 then Log("Esc"), etc....

It logs all the keys except Print Screen.

Once again: I AM SORRY FOR POSTING DELPHI CODE - YOU ASKED FOR IT!!!

I included the exe file for those, who don't have delphi compiler.

Anyway, just try it (and see how a keylogger must be done:) before posting your "timered" keyloggers here.

{To you Ian - Why don't you make a DELPHI section here ????!!!!!!}
